// shadowing is different than mut because instead of reassigning the value of a variable,

// scalar types represent a single value and have four primary types:
// integers, floating point numbers, booleans, characters

// integers are a number without a fractional component and can be signed (include negatives: i)

//
// the data length of the integer has 6 options (default is i32):
// 8bit, 16bit, 32bit, 64bit, 128bit, and arch (dependent on pc architecture i.e. 32bit/64bit)
//
// integer overflow will occur if value is outside datatype bounds, causing wrapping to the value

let num: i8 = 42; // signed 8 bit

// rust's boolean values can be implemented as seen below:
let t = true;
let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation

// char values are the most primitive alphabetic type and use single quotes (whereas string literals
// use double quotes)
// chars are represented by Unicode Scalar Value and can therefore use more than just ASCII

// tuples group together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type
// to define:
let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
// to easily destructure:
let (x, y, z) = tup;
// to directly access an element:
let five_hundred = tup.0;
let six_point_four = tup.1;
let one = tup.2;

// in rust, arrays are like tuples, however all elements must have the same type and a fixed length
// arrays have their data allocated on the stack instead of the heap
// rust will panic at runtime if you try to access an out of bounds element of an array
// to define:
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let b = [3; 5]; //creates an array where all elements have the value 3
// accessing elements
let first = a[0];

// rust starts and runs in the main() function
// function names should be lower snake case and can be defined like the following:
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
    another_function(); // calling a second function
}
fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}

// parameters can be passed to functions, however all parameters must have a defined type and be
// defined in the function declaration
// multiple parameters can be defined using commas

// Expressions evaluate to a resulting value
// expressions do not have a semicolon at the end of the line, if it does, it is actually a statement
let y = {
    let x = 3;

// return values allow function to send data back to the code that calls them
// return values are not named, but must be declared with ->
// statements cannot be returned, but expressions can

    5

// if expressions allow you to run snippets of code based on certain conditions
// the condition logic must always result in a boolean value
// only the first block with logic that evaluates to true will be run
// elif can be used for multiple conditions
// else can be used as an endcap for coverage if none of the other conditions evaluate to true
