// shadowing is when you create a second variable with the same name but give it a different value
// in this case the second variable will "overshadow" the original until it itself is shadowed
// or ultimately when it's scope ends
//
// shadowing is different than mut because instead of reassigning the value of a variable,
// it is instead creating a second variable with the same name of a different value using the "let"
// keyword
//
// with shadowing, we can change the datatype of the variable which can't be done with mut

// scalar types represent a single value and have four primary types:
// integers, floating point numbers, booleans, characters

// integers are a number without a fractional component and can be signed (include negatives: i)
// or unsigned (only positive numbers: u)
//
// the data length of the integer has 6 options (default is i32):
// 8bit, 16bit, 32bit, 64bit, 128bit, and arch (dependent on pc architecture i.e. 32bit/64bit)
//
// integer overflow will occur if value is outside datatype bounds, causing wrapping to the value

let num: i8 = 42; // signed 8 bit
let num: u128 = 42; // unsigned 128 bit

// integer literals can be written in 5 ways:
// decimal, hex, octal, binary, byte(u8 only)
let dec: i32 = 98_222;
let hex: i32 = 0xff;
let oct: i32 = 0o77;

// floating points are numbers with decimal points, and all fp numbers are signed in rust
// there are two types in rust, f32 and f64 (f64 is the default type)

let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32

// rust has all the basic mathematical operators built in
// addition
let sum = 5 + 10;
// subtraction
let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;
// multiplication
let product = 4 * 30;
// division -- integer division rounds down to the nearest integer
let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
let floored = 2 / 3; // Results in 0
// remainder
let remainder = 43 % 5;

// rust's boolean values can be implemented as seen below:
let t = true;
let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation

// char values are the most primitive alphabetic type and use single quotes (whereas string literals
// use double quotes)
// chars are represented by Unicode Scalar Value and can therefore use more than just ASCII
// i.e. accented letters, asian language characters, emojis, and zero width characters
let c = 'z';
let z: char = 'â„¤'; // with explicit type annotation
let rustaceans = 'ðŸ¦€';

// tuples group together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type
// to define:
let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
// to easily destructure:
let (x, y, z) = tup;
// to directly access an element:
let five_hundred = tup.0;
let six_point_four = tup.1;
let one = tup.2;

// in rust, arrays are like tuples, however all elements must have the same type and a fixed length
// arrays have their data allocated on the stack instead of the heap
// rust will panic at runtime if you try to access an out of bounds element of an array
// to define:
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let b = [3; 5]; //creates an array where all elements have the value 3
// accessing elements
let first = a[0];
let second = a[1];
